# Book recommendation system
### **TASK:** Create a recommendation system for books using a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zygmunt/goodbooks-10k) from Kaggle.

A **Content-Based** or **Item-Item recommendation system** attempts to figure out what a user's favourite aspects of an item is, and then recommends items that present those aspects.

In this case, I'm going to figure out book recommendations for a user based on the authors of the books they've read and ratings given by them.
